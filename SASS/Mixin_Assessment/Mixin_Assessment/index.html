    <h1>Embedding a Dashboard in a Webpage</h1><p>Embedding a dashboard into an existing web application lets you monitor current data from a single page through interactive data visualizations, which is now possible with the Syncfusion Dashboard Platform. You can embed an existing dashboard into your webpage through JavaScript API or embedded code.Although the Dashboard Server itself provides a web interface for managing and sharing the dashboards you create, by embedding a dashboard within your own application, you can create a single location for your users to access all the data visualizations pertinent to your organization’s daily business.</p>
