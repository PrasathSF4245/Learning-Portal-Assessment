    <div id="box4">Sass @extend Directive
        The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
        The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small
        details
        The following Sass example first creates a basic style for buttons (this style will be used for most buttons).
        <!-- Then, we create one style for a "Report" button and one style for a "Submit" button. Both "Report" and "Submit"
        button inherit all the CSS properties from the .button-basic class, through the @extend directive. In addition,
        they have their own colors defined:--></div>
